    "#### Zipf's Law\n",
    "The goal with Zipf`s Law was to identify how much the **chess language** (moves language) is related to a \"classic\" natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do that a comparison was made between the chess dataset and a dataset containing the plays of Shakespear (it should be a good representation of english language), to understand if the sequence of moves in chess could be identified as Natural Language\n",
    "\n",
    "The Zipf`s Law is defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$f(r) = \\frac{C}{r^s}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where f(r) is the frequency of the word at rank r, C is a constant, and s is the Zipf`s exponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Zipf's exponent is useful to answer the question proposed since:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if **s<1**: The distribution flattens. Frequencies are more evenly spread across ranks, indicating a more uniform distribution of items.\n",
    "- if **s=1**: The classic Zipfian case. The second-ranked item occurs half as frequently as the first, and so on. This implies that a few words are extremely common, and many are rare. The classic natural languages are usually Zipfian.\n",
    "- if **s>1**: The distribution is steeper.\n",
    "    High-ranked items dominate, and lower-ranked items become significantly rare. \n",
    "    This suggests a system where a few elements are overwhelmingly prevalent."
